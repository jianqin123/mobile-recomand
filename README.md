# the 1st solution about Accurate Marketing Based on User Trajectory in Big Data and Cloud Computing Smart Competition
this is the 1st solution about Accurate Marketing Based on User Trajectory in Big Data and Cloud Computing Smart Competition,
which try to recomand the most appropriate shop for user based on LBS ,the data there includes shop infomation and user infomation.
##  More detail about our algorithm is shown is mobile recomand.pptx ,and how to run the code of this repository is shown is readme.doc file 
## conclusion 
### advantage<br>
1,模型的鲁棒性强，初赛和复赛大部分时间都是第一<br>
2,多模型融合，取各自正确率高的部分综合推荐<br>
3,借鉴协同过滤思想，同时考虑用户的位置以及用户的历史行为<br>
4,训练集优化，搜索效率高；划定作用域，个性化高效过滤店铺<br>
5. 构建基于候选集的xgboost二分类算法，弥补规则模型的不足<br>
### disadvantage<br>
1,优化对于小众化店铺的推荐<br>
2,在模型二中丰富特征提取，提高离线预测准确率<br>
